    "Hi, I'm Danyang (Steve). Currently looking for frontend opportunities in Melbourne. As a graduate of Monash University (Master of IT), I have focused my career and academic goal on frontend development, especially React and React Native. Coding has made my life full of challenges and a sense of accomplishment, and I pride myself as a very effective learner and developer.",
    "During this difficult period, I do not stop learning. Apart from my full-time job, I developed stevechanvii.me, and a developer portfolio website by Node.js. My next goal is to become a full-stack developer, and the good news is I just become an Amazon AWS Certified Associate Architect. However, I know I still have a long way to go, but I look forward to making my effort and applying my skills to your company.",
    "I am passionate about my career as a programmer. If you are interested in my experiences and projects, please contact me.",
